# Cerebro Windows System
> Cerebro plugin to automate some Windows system features

## Usage

In Cerebro, type command that you need and `enter` to execute it. List of available system commands:

* `Brightness X%`
* `Display off`
* `Empty Trash`
* `Hibernate`
* `Lock`
* `Mute`
* `Open Trash`
* `Restart`
* `Screensaver`
* `Shutdown`
* `Sleep`
* `Volume X%`

Specifying a number while typing a command will let you delay the execution of the command by that number of seconds (or minutes, hours, days).
Typing `lock5` or `lock5s` will suggest `Lock in 5 seconds`, `lock5m` will suggest `Lock in 5 minutes`, `lock5h` will suggest `Lock in 5 hours`, `lock5h` will suggest `Lock in 5 days`.
