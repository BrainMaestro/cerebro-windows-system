* `Brightness X%`
* `Display off`
* `Empty Trash`
* `Hibernate`
* `Lock`
* `Mute`
* `Open Trash`
* `Restart`
* `Screensaver`
* `Shutdown`
* `Sleep`
* `Volume X%`

Specifying a number while typing a command will let you delay the execution of the command by that number of seconds.
Typing `lock5` will suggest `Lock in 5 seconds`.
